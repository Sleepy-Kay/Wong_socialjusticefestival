# About
 This is an important festival that raises awareness of how much people suffer but aren’t able to speak up about their issues.  The different situation calls for difficult solutions so many times people aren’t able to share their experiences until it’s ultimately too late. Spreading awareness that different services can help people suffering from their own personal traumas and know they aren’t alone. Making a festival that consists of art-related activities and games that anyone and everyone can participate in. 


# Technical overview
I wanted to work on a website that raises awareness for those who suffer from sexual trauma or any form of trauma that people may struggle to speak about. I want to implement a soft spot in the website that allows the viewer to feel comfortable speaking to other victims. However, the wide range of victims that affect multiple people with different experiences makes it hard. Essentially making it too broad and picking a smaller group of people that I also can relate with helps with the project.
