           Moonlight is a small company that's on a journey on supporting those who are struggling from trauma. 
           Finding a way to help those who are suffering is by working with other communities and making the issue known.

         <p> 
         Our main focus at Moonlight festival is giving awareness to young ladies suffering from past sexual trauma. 
         By coming to the festival, all of the proceeds go to the RAINN foundation.
         The different situation calls for difficult solutions so many times people aren’t able to share their experiences until it’s ultimately too late.
         Spreading awareness that different services can help people suffering from their own personal traumas and know they aren’t alone. 
          Making a festival that consists of art-related activities and games that anyone and everyone can participate in.
